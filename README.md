# Week-2-Homework
This is my portfolio webpage

It contains the following:

    * An about me landing page that includes a picture of me as well as a simple bio section
    * A Portfolio page including links to my LinkedIn and Github pages as well as projects i have completed
    * A contact page which can be used to email me.

In order to view the page you can either view the Github pages associated with this repo, or download the files and open index.html in your favorite web browser.
